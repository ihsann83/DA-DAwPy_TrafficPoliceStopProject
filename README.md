# Examining the dataset

I analyzed a dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project.

Before beginning the analysis, I became familiar with the dataset;

I read the dataset into pandas, examined the first few rows, and then counted the number of missing values. I dropped the 'county_name' column because it only contains missing values, and I dropped the 'state column' because all of the traffic stops took place in one state (Rhode Island). Thus, I dropped those columns, because they contain no useful information.The 'is_arrested' column currently has the object data type. I changed the data type to bool, which is the most suitable type for a column containing True and False values. So, I use mathematical operations on the is_arrested column that would not be possible otherwise. I combined 'stop_date' and 'stop_time' into a single column, and then converted it to datetime format. So, this will enable convenient date-based attributes that I will use later. I set the 'stop_datetime; column as the DataFrame's index. By replacing the default index with a DatetimeIndex, I will make it easier to analyze the dataset by date and time.

Then, I made analysis to explore the relationship between gender and policing;

I examined the violations committed by all drivers to get a baseline understanding of the data, before comparing the violations being committed by each gender. I counted the unique values in the 'violation' column. In order to understand whether male and female drivers tend to commit different types of traffic violations, I created a DataFrame for each gender, and then analyzed the violations in each DataFrame separately. When a driver is pulled over for speeding, many people believe that gender has an impact on whether the driver will receive a ticket or a warning. I examined if there is an evidence for this idea or not. Firstly, I created two DataFrames of drivers who were stopped for speeding: one containing females and the other containing males. Then, for each gender, I used the 'stop_outcome' column to calculate what percentage of stops resulted in a "Citation" (meaning a ticket) versus a "Warning". During a traffic stop, the police officer sometimes conducts a search of the vehicle.  I calculated the percentage of all stops that result in a vehicle search, also known as the search rate. I compared the rates at which female and male drivers are searched during a traffic stop and found that the vehicle search rate across all stops is about 3.8%. I filtered the DataFrame by gender and calculated the search rate for each group separately. Then, I performed the same calculation for both genders at once using a .groupby() Even though the search rate for males is much higher than for females, it's possible that the difference is mostly due to a second factor. For example, you might hypothesize that the search rate varies by violation type, and the difference in search rate between males and females is because they tend to commit different violations. I tested this hypothesis by examining the search rate for each combination of gender and violation. If the hypothesis was true, I would find that males and females are searched at about the same rate for each violation. During a vehicle search, the police officer may pat down the driver to check if they have a weapon. This is known as a "protective frisk.". I firstly checked to see how many times "Protective Frisk" was the only search type. Then, I used a string method to locate all instances in which the driver was frisked. I compared the rates at which female and male drivers are frisked during a search. Are males frisked more often than females, perhaps because police officers consider them to be higher risk?
